### Hello There 👋

I am Sangwin.. Full Stack Web & Mobile Developer.

I design, build, and scale high-performance web applications — from elegant front-end experiences to robust, secure back-end systems. With over 10 years of hands-on experience, I help startups and enterprises turn complex ideas into reliable, scalable products.

I’m a passionate Full-Stack Engineer with a strong focus on solving real-world problems with clean, maintainable code. My expertise spans:

Front-end development

Back-end APIs & microservices

Mobile applications

Cloud deployment & DevOps practices

I thrive on challenges that push me to innovate and implement solutions efficiently. I also mentor junior developers and share best practices to elevate entire teams.

I have a belief that theory teaches us nothing, it's actual implementation which does. I'm set out on a journey of implementing hard earned IT skills to write amazing lines of code. Loving every bit of my work, I am also a music freak & an ardent traveller.
